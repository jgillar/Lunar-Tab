# Lunar-Tab

This is a new tab extension for Chrome that displays some potentially useful information about the moon including current phase and day's moonrise and moonset.

This is not quite ready for the Chrome Web Store since I haven't figured out a good way to keep my API key hidden yet. But in the meantime, you can still try it out if you'd like. To do that just:

1. Download/clone this repository
2. Get your own [Google Geocoding API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key) and add it to config.js.
3. [Install the extension to Chrome as an unpacked extension](https://stackoverflow.com/a/24577660).  
    or  
   Simply view index.html if you just want to see what it looks like. Be warned though, by virtue of being a Chrome extension, it was developed with only Chrome users in mind. There's a chance this will break in other browsers.
